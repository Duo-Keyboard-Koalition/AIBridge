I need to see the CSS file and the HTML templates to fix the background styling issue. Could you please add these files to the chat:

1. btnfun\static\css\styles.css
2. btnfun\templates\index.html
3. btnfun\templates\career_dashboard.html

Once you add these files, I'll be able to identify and fix the CSS issue affecting the background.

I need to see the actual content of the files to fix the CSS issue. The files you added to the chat appear to be empty. Could you please add the files again with their content?
